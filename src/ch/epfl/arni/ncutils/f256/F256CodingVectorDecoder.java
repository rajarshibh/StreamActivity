 * This class is used to find how to linearly combine coding vectors in order

 * decoded coded packets.
 *
 * The algorithm used in this class is a modification of the standard Gaussian-
 * Jordan elimination. Each coding vector inserted is simplified with elementary
 * rows operations trying to obtain an elementary vector. The operations
 * performed are kept track in an auxiliary vector (one per added vector).
 *
 * Internally the class uses O(NÂ²) memory where N is the maximum number of 
 * packets that can get combined.
 *
 * This class uses a vectors over F_{2^8}
